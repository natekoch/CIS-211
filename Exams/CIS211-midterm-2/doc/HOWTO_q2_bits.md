# Q2: Bits

This problem asks you to pack three small 
non-negative integers into unsigned bit fields 
in a 16-bit word (represented as a Python int).

You may find comments in the code as clear 
as this explanation.   

Bits 11..15 of the packed word should hold
the 5 bit unsigned quantity x. 

Bits 6..10 of the packed word should hold 
the 5 bit unsigned quantity y. 

Bits 0..5 of the packed word should hold
the 6 bit unsigned quantity z. 

## You may assume ... 

You may assume that the arguments to 
`pack556` are non-negative integers in the 
correct ranges.  The starter code includes 
assertions to check this. 

You may assume that the argument to `unpack556`
is an integer that was returned by `pack556`.
